Online Banking System - Secure Transaction Platform
System Description
This online banking system is basically a platform that lets customers do their banking stuff online like checking accounts transfering money and paying bills. Its designed to handle tons of transactions every day while keeping everyones data safe. The system connects with different payment networks and has to follow all those banking rules and regulations that banks have to deal with.
Justification for Dependability and Security Needs
This system really needs to be secure and dependable because:

Money is involved - if something goes wrong people could loose their money which would be really bad
Banking laws - theres so many regulations we have to follow like PCI-DSS and other compliance stuff
Customer trust - people need to trust that there money is safe or they wont use our system
Always available - customers expect to access there accounts 24/7 so we cant have much downtime
Private information - we store really sensitive stuff like account numbers and personal data that hackers would love to get
